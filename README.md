## Title

Immunogram: a Generalized Framework to Measure a Person's Immune System.

## Abstract

"How is my immune system?" This is a simple question, but there is no metric to assess the overall performance of the human immune system. The current approaches for answering this are case-by-case (based on context-specific markers like Ig-dsDNA), over simplifying (based on general markers like IL6), or noisy (based on all-encompassing omics analytics). This project aims to develop Immunogram, a generalized framework to measure a person's immune system. We do so by 1) designing a Julia-based program Kumo.jl for linking cells, proteins, and other molecules; 2) using Kumo to link practical immune elements into an intuitive network; 3) using the network to regularize omics matrix factorization and delineate immune patterns; and 4) using the patterns to summarize a person's immune system. We used Immunogram to identify immune cell types, vaccination responses, and various other immune phenotypes.
