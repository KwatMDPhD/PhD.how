## Generalized truth: a framework that all immune phenotypes arise from

There is not a single organ that is solely responsible for the immune system, which is a function of the marrow, the lymph nodes, the blood, and blood vessels, and tissues. The immune system affects nearly all physiologic systems and also closely depends on them. However, evolution must have generated a common denominator that developed into this complexity and thus can explain it. I hypothesize this denominator to be the interactions among immune cells, molecules, and others. Perhaps, non-immune systems at some point were function of molecular interactions, until they developed specialized organs and masses that evolved into their generalized truth, but the generality of the immune system forbid such development.

## Parsimonious measurements: the framework's most informative features

Suppose all immune phenotypes arise from molecular interactions, then some interactions must be more essential in shaping the immune functions than others. These essential interactions may always participate in the beginning of most immune phenotypes and drive generalized phenotypes such as phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and other classical immune patterns. Furthermore, these interactions may also be conserved among species. I hypothesize these interactions to be the ones that are considered classical, such as an antigen-presenting cell using MHC2 to present an antigen to a CD4 T cell. The classical immune interactions were largely discovered in mice and are conserved in humans. These interactions have been known for decades and are involved in most immune phenotypes.

## One-for-all robustness

If the assumptions that the generalized truth that enables immunogram is the immune interactions and that the classical interactions are the dominant elements of the interaction, then these elements, their interactions, and the combination of the interactions should explain multiple immune phenotypes like aging, gestation, autoimmune disorders, vaccine responses, and more. This one-for-all robustness must incorporate all essential interactions necessary, because missing of an important interaction of aging decreases the sensitivity of immunogram in capturing aging. One phenotype at a time, updating the classical interactions as needed, immunogram should capture the biology. When immunogram can capture all challenged phenotypes, it matures into a clinical bioinformatics framework.

## Clinical catalogue

There are about one hundred autoimmune disorders and one hundred immunodeficiencies. For each disorder, immunogram must be applied and its output explained. By applying immunogram on all of these phenotypes, the clinical catalogue emerges.
