## "How is my immune system?"

This is a simple question, but there is no satisfying way to answer it. The current approaches for answering this are case-by-case (based on context-specific markers like Ig-dsDNA), over simplifying (based on general markers like IL6), or noisy (based on all-encompassing omics analytics). There is no metric to assess the overall performance of the human immune system.

This project aims to develop immunogram, a generalized framework to measure a person's immune system.

## Biomarkers may not be good enough to the basis of immunogram

Although it is tempting to develop immunogram by identifying immune-phenotype differentiating biomarkers, for example identifying the ones that correlate with the severity of systemic erythematous lupus (SLE), there are about one hundred autoimmune disorders and as many immunodeficiencies, making the required number of biomarkers that must be measured to report a general immune health difficult. Additionally, immune phenotype specific biomarkers must be able to differentiate among themselves, exponentially increasing the number of biomarker validation. Furthermore, in nearly all medical fields people are discovering new biomarkers each year, but these rarely translate into the medical practice. This low rate of translation may be the result of three weaknesses in using biomarkers in clinics.

First, a set of discovered biomarkers often contain elements (genes, proteins, etc) that do not explain the phenotype; these biomarkers may actually play important unknown roles in the phenotype; or they are mere correlates of the phenotype, making it difficult to motivate their clinical adoption. In fact, some biomarkers discovered years ago are still being pitched for their adoption.

Secondly, biomarkers are often platform specific; transcriptional biomarkers discovered using microarrays and RNA sequencing may not match. So by the time a set of biomarkers are being pursued for their clinical utility, the platforms may have changed enough to make their widespread clinical adoption logistically challenging. Also, using high throughput measurements like transcriptome to find a set of features often suffer from the platform's background signals, making the discovered biomarkers difficult to generalized to other platforms. This is why there are many gene signatures, or gene sets, for various human phenotypes, yet none of them are used to identify their phenotypes in clinics; using these gene sets in research settings is already challenging let along their clinical use.

## Immunogram should be based on transparent features, who combinations explain immune phenotypes

Clinicians have been measuring the complete blood count (CBC) for years diagnosing various human disorders. CBC measurement is a generalized framework to assess human disorders, especially hematopoietic ones. Thus, immunogram should be like CBC, if not its updated form.

CBC is an widely adopted, informative, and successful clinical bioinformatics framework because it measures a small set of features, the amount of general immune cells, whose combinations help explain various phenotypes. Interpreting a feature's value requires understanding only classical immunology and is simple. This framework where a simple set of features and its numerous combinatorics explaining various human phenotypes may have accelerated its ubiquitous clinical adoption.
