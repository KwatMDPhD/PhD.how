## Title

Immunogram: a Generalized Framework to Measure a Person's Immune System.

## Abstract

"How is my immune system?" This is a simple question, but there is no metric to assess the overall performance of the human immune system. Current clinical methods that evaluate a personâ€™s immune system only provide limited information, like cell counts or immunoglobulin levels, and fail to capture the global immune state. This project aims to develop Immunogram, a generalized framework to measure a person's immune system. Immunogram is a Julia-based software that links cells, proteins, and other molecules in a knowledge graph. Immunogram delineates subgraph patterns that describe human immune states and uses them to characterize a person's immune system. Immunogram can be used to identify immune cell types, predict vaccine response, and determine if a person has an ongoing infection.
