## Clinical bioinformatics frameworks have 4 commonalities

In clinics, various bioinformatics frameworks are at play. These tend to have a "-ogram" suffix, like electrocardiogram. Strep throat questionnaire, although lacking the suffix, is also an example of clinical bioinformatics frameworks. Immunogram aims to be a such framework. So analyzing these frameworks' commonalities and emulating them should help develop immunogram.

The existing clinical bioinformatics frameworks have 4 commonalities. First, these frameworks are made possible by the presence of generalized truth. For example, electrocardiogram can measure health phenotypes of various people because the heart, serving as electrocardiogram's generalized truth, is constant enough among people. Secondly, these frameworks measure, instead of thousands, limited yet most informative features and rely on their combinations to make a clinical assessments. For example, electrocardiogram uses only six electric leads. Thirdly, these frameworks can detect not only their designed disorder phenotypes but also various related phenotypes. For example, electrocardiogram can be used to assess the heart during exercise, sleep, and various functional states. Finally, because these frameworks are general, they have been used in nearly all disorders to develop their comprehensive clinical catalogues. For example, electrocardiogram's patterns are in nearly all medical-school text books.

## Clinical bioinformatics frameworks versus machine learning frameoworks

Bioinformatics frameworks deployed in clinics are different from machine learning frameworks, which have been struggling to find their clinical adoption. This could be due to three reasons. First, while the current clinical frameworks can conclude about a wide range of phenotypes related to their generalized truth, machine learning ones conclude about a narrow range of, if not only one, phenotype. Secondly, while the current clinical frameworks measure a smaller number of more relevant features, machine learning ones require a much bigger number of features, which often are less informative about the phenotype of interest and more about the particular sample being measured, resulting in over fitting. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the current clinical frameworks are much more transparent than machine learning ones; and the clinicians rarely (if at all) let black boxed machine learning models to make patient assessments.

## Immunogram for a new clinical bioinformatics framework

Immunogram should too rely on a generalized truth in the immune system, identify its parsimonious measurements, and explain all immune phenotypes, resulting in a comprehensive clinical catalogue based on immunogram.

## Generalized truth: a framework that all immune phenotypes arise from

There is not a single organ that is solely responsible for the immune system, which is a function of the marrow, the lymph nodes, the blood, and blood vessels, and tissues. The immune system affects nearly all physiologic systems and also closely depends on them. However, evolution must have generated a common denominator that developed into this complexity and thus can explain it. I hypothesize this denominator to be the interactions among immune cells, molecules, and others. Perhaps, non-immune systems at some point were function of molecular interactions, until they developed specialized organs and masses that evolved into their generalized truth, but the generality of the immune system forbid such development.

## Parsimonious measurements: the framework's most informative features

Suppose all immune phenotypes arise from molecular interactions, then some interactions must be more essential in shaping the immune functions than others. These essential interactions may always participate in the beginning of all immune phenotypes and drive generalized phenotypes such as phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and other classical immune patterns. Furthermore, these interactions may also be conserved among species. I hypothesize these interactions to be the ones that are considered classical.
