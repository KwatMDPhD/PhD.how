We identified human immune genes not found in mice. Then, we intersected these genes with human neural genes and identified ones also found in neural populations.

The identified human immune genes may help translate immune research in mice to humans. The identified human immune and neural genes may have conferred humans unique molecular attributes that helped shape the central nervous system.
